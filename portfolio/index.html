					Portfolio
				</h2>
				This is a collection of the past projects I've made. <br><br>
				It makes sense to note that the main reason I got into game development was because
				of school. Hence, the major projects were school projects that were submitted for scholarship.
				Minor projects mostly consist of game jam submissions and other smaller productions.<br><br><br>
