				<h3>
					A co-op survival game where everything can kill
				</h3>
				<h5>
					    In this 3D co-op metroidvania largely inspired by Rain World and 
						Lethal Company, you play as a skrunk, a lowly pack animal, lost in a harsh 
						and unforgiving ecosystem. You must survive by hunting prey for food and 
						finding shelter, whilst avoiding becoming prey yourself in a world where 
						anything can kill -- including the sun.

				<h3>Developer Commentary</h3>

				My most recent project - and the one that's been developed for the longest.
				At the start, I wanted to learn networking and multiplayer basics, and also 
				learn how to use Valve's Steamworks SDK.
				<br><br>
				Much like Amelioration, this game was developed for the NZQA Technology Scholarship for 2025.
				Results have not been released yet, but the report written for this is readable anyway. 
				<br><br>
				<a href="scholarship.pdf">Scholarship Report</a>
				<br><br>
				If you want specifics about the development process, I'd recommend reading the scholarship report above.
				<br><br><br>

				Despite the scholarship being submitted, I'm continuing development on it as I still 
				consider it incomplete. It's currently released on Itch.io, but I eventually want to 
				release this to Steam - given it's usage of Steam's APIs.
				<br><br>
				Updates and improvements are actively occuring - the game is far from complete.
