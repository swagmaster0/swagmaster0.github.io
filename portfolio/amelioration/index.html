				<h3>Developer Commentary</h3>

				This game was made for the NZQA Technology Scholarship in 2024, which it won. <br>
				<span style="font-size: 0.5em;">Does this count as award winning?</span>
				
				<br><br>
				The scholarship is a written report based on a year long project, detailing the development, ideation, and research
				behind it. It can be accessed  below.<br><br>
				<a href="scholarship.pdf">Scholarship Report</a>
				<br><br>
				If you want to know specifics about the development processes and ideation, read the scholarship report.

				<br>

				This was one of my first game development experiences - there were a lot of mistakes made that 
				I've learned from since. For instance, the game story I find to be a bit corny - and it also 
				appears rushed in some areas. Some levels are frustrating to beat, and there are only 10 levels.
				<br><br>
				It also doesn't help that the game was a little under-baked - it was developed within a 6 month period
				(April 2024 -> October 2024).
				<br><br>
				In a way, I might continue development to fix these mistakes - I still have ideas for this 
				game, particularly for more content and story revisions. Although, I have no idea if this will ever come to fruition.
