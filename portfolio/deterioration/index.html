				This game was made just after Amelioration for Godot Wild Jam #76.
				With this game, I wanted to try C# programming. I was sick of Godot's GDScript because of it's
				exclusivity to Godot, and wanted to try something more universal and widespread. 

				<br>
				<br>

				In hindsight, this could have been better. 
				The game's visuals were over-stylised and hard to decern, and some gameplay elements were frustrating to deal with.
				Otherwise, I learned a lot from this project - which then led to the beginning of Sunrise.
